# Logit Model Review

In this repository you will find a review about Logistic Regression with the LogisticRegression library from scikit learn.

This study was carried out using a diabetes dataset, whose dependent variable is the existence of the disease (binary logistic model). I do not intend to approach the best model for this type of challenge, but rather to explore model construction, validation plots and improvement techniques.

As always, any collaboration is welcome. So feel free to send me tips, suggestions and corrections.

Thx!
